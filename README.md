### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vanesa, a passionate web and software developer with experience in WordPress and web technologies. Currently, I'm studying Software Development and Web Development with React at UTN. I've completed courses on Platzi and Udemy and graduated from the Oracle One program "Backend developer Java with Spring - ONE." I've also advanced my JavaScript skills.

ðŸ’¼ I'm seeking my first job in information technology.

ðŸš€ I'd love to collaborate on projects that use CSS, JavaScript, React, Python, or Java.

Connect with me and let's explore new opportunities together!
